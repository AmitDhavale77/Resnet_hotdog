# **High-Dimensional Image Classification with Custom Neural Network Layers**

## **Introduction**
This project focuses on exploring deep learning functionalities by implementing key PyTorch neural network operations and designing a model for high-dimensional image classification. By manually building fundamental neural network layers and optimizing a classifier, the project provides hands-on experience in deep learning.

## **Objectives**
- Develop a deep understanding of convolutional, pooling, linear, and batch normalization operations.  
- Implement these layers from basic building blocks using PyTorch.  
- Design, train, and optimize a neural network for classifying high-dimensional image data.  

## **Requirements**
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
